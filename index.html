  <h3>🥐Crossiant</h3>
  <p>A croissant (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃] (listen)) is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
    shape of
    the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[1][better source needed] Croissants are
    named
    for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
    succession,
    then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
    similar to a puff pastry.</p>
